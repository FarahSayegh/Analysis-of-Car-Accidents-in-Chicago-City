# 🚗 Analysis of Car Accidents in Chicago City

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of car accidents in Chicago, utilizing data exploration and visualization techniques to uncover insights and trends. The goal is to better understand factors contributing to accidents and provide actionable findings.

## 📄 Project Overview

The notebook includes:

* Loading and preprocessing Chicago car accident data
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Visualization of accident patterns (time, location, severity, weather conditions)
* Key insights and recommendations

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Pandas**
* **Matplotlib**
* **Seaborn**
* **NumPy**

## 📊 Data

The dataset used for this analysis contains records of car accidents in Chicago city, including information on time, location, conditions, and other attributes.

> **Note:** Please refer to the notebook for data source details and preprocessing steps.

## 📌 Results

The analysis highlights:

* Peak accident times and days, with late afternoon and evening hours showing the highest number of incidents.
* High-risk areas identified around major intersections and highways in the city.
* Weather-related accident trends, showing an increase in accidents during rainy and snowy conditions.
* Seasonal variations in accidents, with winter months experiencing higher severity incidents.
* Correlation between lighting conditions and accident severity, with poor lighting linked to more severe accidents.
* Distribution of accidents by driver age groups, showing younger drivers (18-25) involved in a higher percentage of accidents.
* Visualization of accident counts by day of the week, highlighting weekends as slightly more prone to incidents.

Check out the notebook for detailed graphs, maps, and interpretations.

## 💡 Future Work

Potential next steps include:

* Building a predictive model for accident severity
* Integrating real-time traffic or weather data
* Expanding analysis to other cities for comparison
* Conducting a spatial clustering analysis to identify accident hotspots
